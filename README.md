## About
A simple RPi based video recorder.

## Checklist
1. [ ] Add all possible camera (PiCam and USB cam) settings
2. [ ] Take user input for these settings and once the settings are applied, a preview should be saved. When
 		everything is done, recording starts.
3. [ ] When recording ends then ask the user if any intro/watermark needs to be added.
4. [ ] Pi should act as an AP and should run a web service in which we'll have camera settings, record/stop
		button and post.
5. [ ] Design a 3D case.

## Tech Stack
